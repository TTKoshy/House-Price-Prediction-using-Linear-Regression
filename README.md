# House-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression

## Problem Statement:
Predict the housing prices based on the features of the locality provided to us. In the process, we need to identify the most important features in the dataset. We need to employ techniques of data preprocessing and build a linear regression model that predicts the prices for us.

## Dataset Information:
The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data.

Detailed attribute information is given below:

- longitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west
- latitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north
- housingMedianAge: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building
- totalRooms: Total number of rooms within a block
- totalBedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block
- population: Total number of people residing within a block
- households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block
- medianIncome: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)
- medianHouseValue: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)
- oceanProximity: Location of the house w.r.t se w.r.t ocean/sea
